# File Permissions
## In Linux, file permissions helps us to define who can read, write and execute file and directories.
### There are three basic file permissions:
  - **_Read_**: Denoted by (r or 4), provides the permission to view the file.
  - **_Write_**: Denoted by (w or 2), provides the permission to modify or write the file.
  - **_Execute_**: Denoted by (x or 1), provides the permissions to run the file as a program.

 |Permissions|Symbolic|Numeric|
 |:---------:|:------:|:-----:|
